    <p>Michael Batavia is a software programmer at the Bronx High School of Science who is an advanced programmer in Java, C++ and Python. Michael has shown his programming commitment through his cooperation as a member of the Bronx Science Hackers Club and is the current president of the <a href="bxsml.org"> Bronx Science Machine Learning Club</a>. He has created several research projects under the supervision of Dr. Shapovalov with Stony Brook professor Dr. Yuefan Deng. You can see his project <a href=https://github.com/AstroNoodles/Mini-Projects/blob/master/Parallel_CNN_Test_Ground.ipynb]>here</a>.  Also featured in the list of projects, he created a specialized convolutional neural network to diagnose breast cancer effectively and improves on previous experts' limitations. He is also a member of the non-profit <a href="teenhacksli.com">TeenHacksLI</a> and effectively designed workshops, advocated for the event in his school and obtained partnerships with leading start-ups in computer science. He is also interested in biochemistry, classical and modern physics through his contribution in the <a href="tinyurl.com/reactions2-2019"><cite>Reactions</cite></a> physical science journal at his school. He is currently a senior editor in the magazine.</p>

        <figcaption>I am the current <strong>executive director </strong> of the non-profit organization TeenHacks LI whose goal is to bring entrepreneurship and innovation to all kids in the tri-state area. We hope to create a collaborative coding space for everyone to code what they dream to make and to make a business out of their newfound love of coding. We have partnered with MLH for our 3 years of operation and are proud to announce that TeenHacks LI is Long Island's number one premier hackathon.</figcaption>

        <figcaption>In 2019, I was the <strong> director of logistics </strong> in charge of ordering the food, the furniture and maintaining hacker happiness during the two-day event at the Bushwick Generator in Brooklyn, NY. H2Hacks was a unique hackathon where hackers mobilized along the east coast to use technology to solve real-world environmental problems and teach their community about environmental sustainability, conservation and awareness. With projects ranging from a soil pH detector created with a Raspberry Pi to a game to collect trash drifting to the sea floor before the sea animals eat them and die from poisoning, H2Hacks was a unique hackathon that focused on a topic that is usually only reserved for a single prize track at a hackathon. You can see the event's photo album <a target="_blank" href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/EPqjvgocvm9GCAQ78">here</a> and the DevPost for the event <a target="_blank" href="https://h2hacks.devpost.com">here</a>. </figcaption>

        As the <strong> chief machine learning engineer </strong> in an internship with Dr. John Ross Rizzo at NYU Langone Health, I am responsible for providing images of construction related equipment to an object detection model to classify. Built on the TensorFlow object detection framework, this model's purpose is to be a part of a critical portion of hardware soon to be built that can help the blind navigate the busy NYC streets, where construction is done nearly every day. Based on Dr. Rizzo's own peripheral vision degradation, this model would help not only him but the 418,500 blind New Yorkers and the nearly 7 million blind citizens in the United States of America according to the National Federation Of The Blind. Furthermore, this model has encouraged me to apply standard machine learning procedures like file preprocessing and image data generation for a grand and fulfilling purpose.
