      <p> In addition to being a leader of hackathons, I am also one of the publishers of <cite> Reactions</cite>, the only physical science based publication in the Bronx High School of Science. In the 2019 publication as a senior editor, he published two articles detailing recent discoveries in preventing polluting manufacturing with the use of water and how we can use oligopeptides to store large quantities of information as an alternative to the cloud, which is Internet based. He contributed to the 'Did You Know?' section as well. As the <strong> editor in chief </strong> of the magazine in 2020, he contributed further by adding an article about the mysteries and disasters of chirality and added a COVID-19 special tying in current events with a way to inactive the virus with copper. He also contributed to the 'Did You Know?' section and crossword as well.  </p>

          <p> In senior year in Bronx Science, I combined my interests in machine learning with the social sciences to prove the essential question of "How does humor affect SAT scores?" My partner, Sadia Safa, did the surveys and completed the statistics to show that by watching a humorous video before taking a standardized test, one could improve their test score by an increase of 500 points. By using a method easier and more applicable to minorities, this could a potential factor to <em> prevent high school dropout </em> and prevent the 72.7% of African-Americans dropping out of high school if they do not get an excellent standardized test score for college. To validate this result, I applied a K Nearest Neighbors classifier to the data and showed that <strong> AI can be creative </strong> and prove that given a test score, an AI can predict whether the given video was funny or not funny 75% of the time according to the ROC-AUC score. Simple machine learning can have huge applications. </p>

            <p> For my own research project with assistance from <a href="https://www.bxscience.edu/apps/pages/index.jsp?uREC_ID=130114&type=u" target="_blank">Dr. Vladimir Shapovalov</a> and <a href="https://www.stonybrook.edu/commcms/iedm/about/leadership/YuefanDeng" target="_blank">Dr. Yuefan Deng</a>, I decided to combine my skills in machine learning and deep learning to <b> analyze breast cancer DICOM slides to determine if a tumor is benign or malignant.</b> To make my project unique, I used several techniques including hyperparameter tuning using <cite> <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/keras/keras_tuner" target="_blank">keras-tuner</a></cite>, data parallelism using a multi GPU model, class weights and a specific logarithmic factor to correct class imbalance in the dataset and a custom deep neural network that models VGG16. I also used the optimizer SGD (stochastic gradient descent) with momentum over the more popular adaptive optimizers such as ADAM. My results show that using SGD with momentum may still perform accurate and near state of the art results. The use of data parallelism also crosses over the mathematical difficulties that modern convolutional neural networks have in generalizing to medical datasets. As a result, radiologists can use my model to assist their decision on whether proper schema treatment is needed to treat a malignant breast tumor and whether treatment is needed at the moment to prevent the cancer from spreading to the lymph nodes. This project only adds to my arsenal on how deep learning can be <strong> practical </strong> and <strong> save lives. </strong> </p>

       <p> In 2017, I was one of the lucky contenders in my middle school to participate in the Guppy App Challenge where CA Technologies partnered with PENCIL in order to afford middle schoolers an opportunity to create an app to help New Yorkers. Using my app skills in Java and in the Android SDK, I created an app to help New Yorkers with memory-deteriorating problems easily remember the common choice in a variety of scenarios and add reminders for future choices. <strong>The app is aptly named Choice! and is available for download on the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/sunshine-deluxe-Choice/dp/B0711SNV7F" target="_blank">Amazon App Store.</a></strong> The code is also available on my GitHub listed above. It was my first adventure in creating an Android application for both a market, an impactful purpose and in a team effort. This is just a sample of my excellent skill in writing Java with the Android SDK to make applications to help disabled, autistic and disadvantaged communities.
